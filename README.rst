The PennyLane-Honeywell plugin provides the ability to use Honeywell Quantum Solutions' ion-trap
quantum computing hardware with PennyLane.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.ai>`_ provides open-source tools for
quantum machine learning, quantum computing, quantum chemistry, and hybrid quantum-classical computing.

`Honeywell Quantum Solutions <https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/company/quantum>`_ provides access to
ion-trap quantum computing hardware over the cloud.

.. note::

    The PennyLane-Honeywell plugin is currently in *beta* release. Expect some features
    to be updated or change in the future.

The plugin documentation can be found here: `PennyLane-Honeywell <https://pennylane-honeywell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Features
========

* Provides a PennyLane device ``honeywell.hqs`` which can be used to access Honeywell Quantum Solutions' online hardware API.

* Supports core PennyLane operations such as qubit rotations, Hadamard, basis state preparations, etc.

Installation
============

PennyLane-Honeywell only requires PennyLane for use, no additional external frameworks are needed.
The plugin can be installed via ``pip``:
::

    $ python3 -m pip install pennylane-honeywell

Alternatively, you can install PennyLane-Honeywell from the source code by navigating to the top directory and running
::

    $ python3 setup.py install


If you currently do not have Python 3 installed,
we recommend `Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_, a distributed
version of Python packaged for scientific computation.

Software tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure that PennyLane-Honeywell is working correctly after installation, the test suite can be
run by navigating to the source code folder and running
::

    $ make test


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the HTML documentation, go to the top-level directory and run
::

    $ make docs

The documentation can then be found in the ``doc/_build/html/`` directory.

Getting started
===============

Once PennyLane-Honeywell is installed, available Honeywell devices can be accessed straight
away in PennyLane. However, the user will need access credentials for the Honeywell Quantum Solutions (HQS) platform in
order to use these remote devices. These credentials should be provided to PennyLane via a
`configuration file or environment variable <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/configuration.html>`_.
Specifically, the variable ``HQS_TOKEN`` must contain a valid access key for HQS's online platform.

You can instantiate the HQS device class for PennyLane as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml
    dev1 = qml.device("honeywell.hqs", "machine_name", wires=2)

where ``machine_name`` is the specific name of the online device you'd like to access. Contact Honeywell Quantum
Solutions to receive platform access and machine names.

HQS devices can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of
quantum circuits within PennyLane. For more details and ideas, see the
`PennyLane website <https://pennylane.ai>`_ and refer
to the `PennyLane documentation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_.
